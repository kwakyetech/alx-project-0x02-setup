# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

Welcome to the **Next.js Project Setup and Basics** repository!

This repository is the foundational setup for a modern web application using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It is part of a broader learning project that guides developers through creating a structured, scalable, and responsive web application from scratch.

Here, you will find:
- The initial project scaffolding
- Configuration files for ESLint, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- A clean project directory to kickstart further development

Stay tuned for upcoming implementations of routing, reusable components, API integration, and responsive layouts.
